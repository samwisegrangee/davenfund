     <p>Have your supervisor approve the request and if there is money in the budget your supervisor will let you know if it was approved.</p>
     <p>A month ago a request was sent in and we are waiting to hear if the amount was approved?</p>
     <p>Your request will take some time as we are checking the budget to see if it was applied to this yearâ€™s budget. Check with your supervisor to see if it has?</p>
     <p>Your request was approved, but it will have to be applied to next years budget, check with your supervisor in six months.</p>
     <p>This is how Davenfund was started I wanted to find a better way to apply for funds to do my work more efficiently. Having the money would have helped purchase the equipment or training I needed, but requesting the money seemed to be a job in itself.</p>
     <p>I decided rather than complain, I would come up with a way that would not take a lot of time or process. My plan was to come up with an idea that Davenport employees could have access to money through a special employee fund already set in the yearly budget. The money from this fund would be awarded to any full time employee based on the importance of how it would be use to improve that employees job. A committee would be formed to randomly select any Davenport fulltime employee who applied for a Davenfund. This fund would be awarded to help purchase equipment or attend a training session. Simply stated an application would be granted to immediately impact some ones job.</p>
     <p>Davenfund was created through channeling my frustrations and challenges in a positive constrictive way to be more useful, productive and efficient at my job. I am hoping the outcome would make all employees become more humble, helpful, and happier knowing Davenfund was created by an employee for Davenport employees to help the way they work around here.</p>
     <p>The part of this story I am most proud of is that people listened to my idea. Then, when it was time to make it happen others joined in to help me make it a reality. I really am very appreciative of all of the support I was given. My story came true and I encourage any employee if they have an idea to improve the way they work to make it happen.</p>
     <p>Sincerely,</p>
     <p>Bernice Ewing</p>
