   <div class="prop-answer-container">
    <p>Each applicant may request between $100 - $2,000 to be used to help him/her to improve what he/she does at DU.  Examples include:  attending a training or conference, equipment such a standing desk, a second computer monitor, software with IT approval, etc.</p>
    <p>A total amount of $10,000 is available to fund selected requests.  For year one, the $10,000 will be available for funding from February 6, 2017 - June 30, 2017. Going forward the program will begin on or around July 1, 2017 each year and have a total of at least $10,000.
    All applications must be completed through our online applications located at <a href="www.davenfund.davenport.edu" target="_blank">www.davenfund.davenport.edu</a>.</p>
    <p>One application is allowed per person per fiscal year (July-June). If you are participating on the DavendFund Committee, you are ineligible to submit an application.</p>
    <p>Applications for DavenFund dollars must not be able to be funded through other funding options, such as <a href="https://www.davenport.edu/me-davenport-grant/programming-criteria" target="_blank">ME Davenport Innovation Fund</a> or items that are able to be funded through a budget line item such as supplies. </p>
    <p>Applications will be accepted from February 6, 2017 – March 31, 2017. A review period will occur from April 1, 2017 – May 1, 2017 to allow for any feedback or request for additional information with current submissions. This will create a final pool of DavenFund Applications.
    <p>The final selection process will occur on May 15, 2017 and will be done by random selection until all funds have been allocated.</p>
    <p>The random selection will be live-streamed through the DavenFund website for year one. For subsequent Fiscal Years, the random selection will occur at Davenfest. Once the winners have been identified, an announcement will go out to all participants. Proposals that are not selected may be resubmitted for the following Fiscal Year. Process Improvement will complete the purchase for your training, equipment or other approved funding request no later than May 31st. In the event that you leave DU, all equipment, software or other tangible items will continue to be owned by DU. For any employee that has been awarded attendance at a conference/training and leaves DU employment prior to attending, the committee reserves the right to re-evaluate the award.
    Six months after your request has been funded or the funded activity has been completed, you will be required to provide a summary of how the funding through DavenFund has positively impacted your performance at DU.</p>
