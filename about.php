     <p>When we started DavenFund, the idea was to help Davenport employees successfully get funding for any conferences, software or equipment that sometimes get overlooked with many competing financial priorities. Overall, we wanted to help employees improve what they do here at Davenport.</p>

     <p>To develop DavenFund, a committee of Davenport employees representing various campuses and departments was formed to help get this program off the ground and running by 2017.</p>

     <p>The first mission was to come up with the name for the program, which we now call DavenFund. After that, the real work began with defining the project and the program work and forming subcommittees to handle tasks like the rules and eligibility, promotions, web design, a review committee process and defining any future obstacles or challenges we may encounter. To finalize the details for the program, we identified and recruited additional Davenport employees with specific expertise to help further define and create excellence within the program.</p>

     <p>What we discovered through our own initiatives were the unknown difficulties that confronted this project with getting it off the ground – lack of funds, staff, you name it – barriers were there, along with the frustrations. However, through perseverance and some luck, we looked at these challenges as opportunities ... not only to get DavenFund up and running, but also to help enhance the culture at Davenport University.</p>

     <p>The bottom line is that through DavenFund and the hard work and effort of current Davenport employees, we have not only created a program that will ultimately benefit our staff, faculty, students and community, we have also changed how we approach project work at Davenport. We did it by learning how to overcome challenges by being persistent and creative to implement improvements more effectively and efficiently.</p>

     <p>Our committee thanks you for participating in DavenFund. So, please apply so you can help make a difference at Davenport. We look forward to your feedback.</p>
